# Seschedule

A bot for telegram that searches [SESC](https://www.sescsp.org.br/) events and reminds about them.

## Using in dev environment

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Install ngrok and run `ngrok http 8443`
  * Update `dev.exs` and `dev.secret.exs` with your new url and token, example:

  ```elixir
  config :seschedule, webhook_url: "https://long-ngrok-url.com" # on dev.exs
  config :telegex, token: "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11" # on dev.secret.exs
  ```
  > Tip: You can create a fixed domain in ngrok in the [domain page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains)

  * Start server with inside IEx with `iex -S mix`


## Deploying in fly.io

  * Use this `fly.toml` with `fly apps create --name {{yourappname}}` to create an app
  * Set the correct secrets:
  ```elixir
  config :seschedule, webhook_url: "https://{{yourappname}}.fly.dev" # on prod.exs
  config :telegex, token: "{{bot-token}}" # on prod.secret.exs
  ```
  * Run `fly deploy`
  > Tip: `fly scale count 1`, if you want to have only one machine working at a time



## TODO:

In order of relevance.

### Tests:

Create more doctests and tests.
* In particular it'll be nice to test if `Texts` `places`, `categories`, and `dates` matches with `protobufs`.
* We will most likely need [Mox](https://hexdocs.pm/mox/Mox.html).

### Docs

* Ensure docs for every module and method.
* Generate docs page.

### CI

Ensure tests and docs are complete via CI.

### Random filters

Random events using filters:
* Filter by city
* Filter by category

### Create storage

* Use a simple [Agent](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.16.0/Agent.html) to manage the events, then our internal search can be more sofisticated.
* Create a periodic call to API to update events (interval should be a config)
* Simple in-memory should suffice

### Order events using event date

Currently the API is using its internal order, which is weird, if we search internally by our storage we can sort the events by date and place.

### Join "Grande SÃ£o Paulo" requests

There is a reference for what SESC units are in Grande SP, if we search in storage we can 

### Give support for SESCs in other states

Currently the search is limited to SESC SP, although there is a lot of SESC units in SP, there are tons in other states.
* We must find what are the other SESCs websites and reverse engineer their APIs.
* We must include them as options to search and possibly change the search flow a little bit.


### Multiple choice in filters

Give support for more than one filter:
* More than one city
* More than one category

### Remind:

Create workflow for remind functionallity.

### Use sqlite3 in storage

Use sqlite3 and Ecto to save events in storage.

### Feedback command

Create a feedback command that sends an email for bug report and suggestions.

### I18n:

Give support for english, spanish and french.
